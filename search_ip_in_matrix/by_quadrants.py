A direct recursive implementation of "Divide and Conquer by Partitioning the Matrix into Quadrants - O(logmÃ—logn)" can be quite complex due to the handling of indices for submatrices.

Currently, there is no efficient way to divide a 2D list (usually how we represent a matrix in Python) into quadrants without using additional space or complex index manipulation. This is because 2D lists in Python (list of lists) don't support the slice operation like NumPy arrays do. It will be extremely hard and inefficient to apply this theory directly into practice using native Python.

However, here's a simplified intuitive approximation of such method by leveraging binary search in Python but it doesn't split the matrix into quadrants:
'''

def searchMatrix(matrix, target):
    def searchRec(left, up, right, down):
        # submatrix has no height or no width.
        if left > right or up > down:
            return False
        # target is already larger than the largest element or smaller
        # than the smallest element in the submatrix.
        elif target < matrix[up][left] or target > matrix[down][right]:
            return False

        mid = left + (right-left)//2

        # Locate 'row' such that matrix[row-1][mid] < target < matrix[row][mid]
        row = up
        while row <= down and matrix[row][mid] <= target:
            if matrix[row][mid] == target:
                return True
            row += 1

        return searchRec(left, row, mid-1, down) or searchRec(mid+1, up, right, row-1)

    if not matrix:
        return False
    return searchRec(0, 0, len(matrix[0])-1, len(matrix)-1)


# Test
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
    [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
    [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
]

print(searchMatrix(matrix, 19))  # Output: True
print(searchMatrix(matrix, 26))  # Output: False


'''
This code begins by checking if the target number is within the smallest and largest elements of the submatrix. If it is, the function attempts to find an index such that the element at that index is less than the target and the element at the next index is greater than the target. The function then calls itself on the submatrices to the top-right and bottom-left of this index.

While this code does not implement partitioning the matrix into quadrants, it should be noted that splitting a matrix into quadrants and applying divide-and-conquer strategy may not necessarily improve our time complexity in Python.
